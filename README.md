# Fermiophobic-gauge-boson

Models with extra gauge symmetry are well motivated extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper, we search for excess of events in search of a heavy 
neutral gauge boson Z′ which is fermiophobic. The search is performed  in the di-lepton channel using ATLAS Open Data at √s = 14 TeV. The analysis uses 
TFraction Fit to calculate the fraction of MC samples contributing to the data. No excess of data with respect to SM predictions are observed. Hence, we 
are able to put a constrain on efficiency times production cross-section times branching ratio.
